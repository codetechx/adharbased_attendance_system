## Key Pages & Features

### Workers
- **WorkerList** (`/workers`) — All / Current / Previous tabs; clickable rows → Worker Detail; ID document column with download links for Aadhaar PDF and other docs
- **WorkerDetail** (`/workers/:id`) — Analytics page: total days, avg hours, monthly breakdown. Company users see only their company's data. Vendor users get a company dropdown to filter per-company; includes deployment history
- **WorkerRegister** (`/workers/register` or `/workers/:id/edit`) — 4-step wizard; edit mode shows existing Aadhaar/document download links
- **WorkerAssign** (`/workers/assign`) — Deploy workers to companies; Current / Previous / All tabs; can cancel even locked deployments if worker is currently checked OUT

### Attendance
- **AttendanceList** (`/attendance`) — Daily summary grouped view: per worker per day shows First IN, Last OUT, duration, and status (Inside / Done / Incomplete). All / Current Workers / Previous Workers tabs. Row click → Worker Detail
- **AttendanceMark** (`/attendance/mark`) — Fingerprint IN/OUT with SecuGen scanner
- **Exceptions** (`/attendance/exceptions`) — Workers currently checked IN without an OUT

### Vendors
- **VendorList** (`/vendors`) — Super admin: full global list + create/edit. Company users: approval-status tabs (Approved / Pending / Suspended / Rejected / All) showing only their company's vendor relationships
- **VendorApproval** (`/vendors/approval`) — Pending / Approved / Rejected / Suspended tabs with counts; approve, reject with reason, suspend, re-approve
- **VendorCompanyAccess** (`/vendors/company-access`) — Vendor-side: request access to companies, track statuses

## Aadhaar Integration

1. On Worker Register page, click **Open UIDAI Portal**
2. Worker logs in on UIDAI site, completes OTP, downloads masked Aadhaar PDF
3. Vendor uploads the PDF — Python service extracts: name, DOB, gender, address, PIN, photo
4. Form auto-fills; vendor reviews and saves
5. PDF stored on private disk (never web-accessible); served via authenticated download endpoint
6. Company users can download a worker's Aadhaar PDF if the worker has ever been deployed to or attended at their company

**PDF Password format:** first 4 letters of name (uppercase) + birth year
Example: Name "Narendra", Born 1955 → password `NARE1955`

---

## Fingerprint Integration (SecuGen SGIBIOSRV)

### Gate PC Setup
1. Install SecuGen SGIBIOSRV (included in FDx SDK)
2. Connect SecuGen device (Hamster Pro, etc.)
3. Start the SGIBIOSRV service
4. On first use, open `https://localhost:8443` in browser and accept the certificate

### How matching works
```
Gate PC Browser
  → POST https://localhost:8443/SGIFPCapture   (capture live fingerprint)
  → GET  /api/attendance/worker-templates      (fetch all enrolled templates for approved vendors)
  → POST https://localhost:8443/SGIMatchScore  (1:N match in parallel, per worker)
  → Best match above score 40/200 → confirm → POST /api/attendance/mark
```

---

## Worker Deployment (WorkerAssign)

Workers can be explicitly deployed to specific companies with a date range. The deployment system:
- Sets `is_locked = true` on first attendance (prevents premature cancel)
- Cancellation allowed even when locked, **provided the worker is not currently checked IN**
- `/workers` and `/attendance` endpoints support `deployment=current` or `deployment=previous` param for tab filtering

### Pushing backend changes (no volume mount)
```bash
# Copy changed file(s) into the running container
docker cp backend/app/Http/Controllers/WorkerController.php \
  ams_backend:/var/www/html/app/Http/Controllers/WorkerController.php

# Clear Laravel's opcode cache
docker exec ams_backend php artisan optimize:clear
```

## Security

- **Authentication:** Laravel Sanctum token (7-day expiry)
- **Authorization:** Role middleware on every route + controller-level scoping
- **Aadhaar:** Only last 4 digits stored in DB; full number never persisted
- **Fingerprint templates:** AES-encrypted at rest via Laravel `encrypt()`
- **Aadhaar PDFs:** Stored on private disk (not web-accessible), served via authenticated download
- **ID documents:** Stored on private disk; company users may download only for workers deployed at their company
- **Audit log:** Every sensitive action (worker created, fingerprint enrolled, Aadhaar downloaded, attendance marked) logged with user ID, timestamp, and IP
- **HTTPS:** Required in production — add SSL certificate to nginx config

---

## Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Set `APP_ENV=production`, `APP_DEBUG=false` in `.env`
- [ ] Run `php artisan key:generate` for a unique `APP_KEY`
- [ ] Use strong passwords for DB, Redis, and all user accounts
- [ ] Add SSL certificates to `nginx/` config
- [ ] Switch file storage to S3: `FILESYSTEM_DISK=s3`
- [ ] Enable Laravel Horizon for queue monitoring
- [ ] Restrict DB port (3306) — do not expose publicly
- [ ] Set up automated MySQL backups
- [ ] Test fingerprint enrollment and matching end-to-end before go-live
