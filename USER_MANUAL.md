## 1. What is AMS?

AMS (Attendance Management System) is a digital system that tracks **when contract workers arrive and leave** a company site — using **fingerprint scanning**, so there is no manual register or paper-based attendance.

### What problems it solves

| Old Way | With AMS |
|---------|----------|
| Paper register — can be faked | Fingerprint — cannot be faked |
| Manual data entry — errors | Auto-recorded with timestamp |
| No visibility for vendor | Vendor sees their workers' attendance live |
| Hard to audit | Full audit trail with every action logged |

---

## 2. Who Uses AMS? (Roles Explained)

AMS has four types of users. Each person sees only what is relevant to their job.

## 7. Vendor Admin Guide

The Vendor Admin is responsible for:
- Requesting access to company sites
- Registering workers with their Aadhaar and fingerprint
- Deploying workers to specific companies
- Viewing attendance reports for their workers

### 7.1 Request Access to a Company

Before your workers can mark attendance at a company, you must request access.

**Where:** Sidebar → Administration → **Company Access**

1. Find the company you want to work with
2. Click **Request Access**
3. Wait for the company admin to approve

**Request statuses:**

---

### 7.2 Register a Worker

Workers must be registered before they can use the fingerprint scanner.

**Where:** Sidebar → Workers → **Register Worker**

#### Step 1 — Aadhaar Details

1. Click **Open UIDAI Portal** — the worker logs in and downloads their masked Aadhaar PDF
2. Upload the PDF. The PDF password is: **first 4 letters of name (UPPERCASE) + birth year**
   - Example: Name "Narendra", Born 1955 → password `NARE1955`
3. The form auto-fills with the worker's details from the PDF

#### Step 2 — Review Worker Details

Check the auto-filled information (Name, DOB, Gender, Address). Make any corrections. Click **Next**.

#### Step 3 — Fingerprint Enrollment

1. Connect the SecuGen fingerprint scanner to the PC
2. Ask the worker to place their **right index finger** on the scanner
3. Click **Scan Fingerprint** — keep the finger pressed for 2 seconds
4. Green checkmark = success

> **Scanner not available?** Click **Skip for now**. The worker is saved as "Pending". Enroll fingerprint later from the Workers list. Workers cannot mark attendance until fingerprint is enrolled.

#### Step 4 — Confirm & Save

Review all details and click **Register Worker**.

---

### 7.3 Edit a Worker

**Where:** Workers list → click worker row → click **Edit**, or Workers list → **Edit** link

In edit mode (Step 0), you can see the worker's existing documents:
- If Aadhaar PDF was uploaded → **Download PDF** link is shown
- If other ID document was uploaded → **Download** link is shown

Upload new Aadhaar or ID documents to replace existing ones.

---

### 7.4 View Your Workers

**Where:** Sidebar → Workers → **All Workers**

The Workers list has three tabs:

| Tab | What it shows |
|-----|--------------|
| **All Workers** | All workers registered under your vendor |
| **Current** | Workers with active deployments at a company today |

- Status badge (Pending / Active / Inactive)

**Click any worker row** to open the **Worker Detail analytics page**.

---

### 7.5 Worker Detail Analytics

**Where:** Click any worker row in the Workers list

The detail page shows:
- **Company dropdown** at the top — switch between companies to see that worker's history at each approved company
- **Stats cards:** Total days, average daily hours, total IN/OUT count
- **Monthly breakdown table:** Days worked, average hours, missed OUT count per month
- **Deployment history:** All deployments for that worker at the selected company
- **Recent attendance:** Last 10 attendance events

---

### 7.6 Deploy Workers to a Company

**Where:** Sidebar → Workers → **Deploy Workers**

After a company approves your vendor, you can deploy specific workers with a date range.

The deployment list has three tabs:

| Tab | What it shows |
|-----|--------------|
| **Current** | Active deployments within today's date range |
| **Previous** | Expired or cancelled deployments |
| **All** | All deployments |

**To cancel a deployment:** Click **Cancel** next to any deployment. You can cancel even after attendance has been marked, **as long as the worker is not currently checked IN**.

---

### 7.7 View Attendance

**Where:** Sidebar → Attendance → **Attendance Log**

Shows a **daily summary** for all your workers across all companies:
- One row per worker per day
- First IN time, Last OUT time, total duration
- Status: Inside / Done / Incomplete

Use the **All / Current / Previous** tabs and date/name filters to narrow results. Click any row to open the worker's full detail page.

---

## 8. Gate User Guide

The Gate User's job is simple: **scan fingerprints** as workers enter and exit.

### 8.1 Setup — First Time Only (Per PC)

1. Make sure the **SecuGen fingerprint scanner** is plugged into the USB port
2. Open the browser and go to `https://localhost:8443`
3. You will see a security warning — click **Advanced** → **Proceed to localhost**

> This is a one-time step per PC that allows the browser to talk to the fingerprint scanner.

---

### 8.2 Mark Attendance — Daily Use

**Where:** Sidebar → Attendance → **Mark Attendance**

**Attendance flow for each worker:**

1. Click **Scan Fingerprint**
2. The circle starts pulsing — tell the worker to place their finger
3. Worker places finger on scanner firmly
4. System identifies the worker and shows their name + pending action (IN or OUT)
5. Click **Confirm IN** or **Confirm OUT**
6. Done! Repeat for the next worker

> **IN vs OUT is automatic:** The system tracks whether the worker's last action was IN or OUT. If they last marked IN, the next scan shows "Pending: OUT".

---

### 8.3 Troubleshooting Fingerprint Issues

| Problem | What to do |
|---------|-----------|
| "No finger detected" | Worker must place finger **immediately** after clicking Scan — don't wait |
| "No fingerprint match found" | Worker's finger may be dirty/wet — clean and try again. If still fails, contact vendor admin to check enrollment |
| "Cannot reach scanner" | Check USB connection. Open `https://localhost:8443` and accept certificate |
| Scanner light doesn't blink | Scanner not connected — check USB. Try a different USB port |
| "No workers found" | Vendor may not be approved for your company — contact company admin |

## 10. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: A worker's fingerprint is not being recognized. What do I do?**

First, try cleaning the worker's finger and the scanner sensor. Ask them to press harder and keep the finger still. If it still fails, the vendor admin should re-enroll the fingerprint from the Workers list → click the worker → re-enroll.

---

**Q: The gate scanner is not working / shows an error.**

1. Check that the SecuGen USB scanner is properly connected
2. In the browser, go to `https://localhost:8443` — if you see a certificate warning, click Advanced → Proceed
3. Refresh the Mark Attendance page and try again

---

**Q: A vendor's workers are not showing up for attendance marking.**

This means the vendor has not been approved yet. The company admin must go to **Vendor Approvals** and approve the vendor. Once approved, their workers are immediately available.

---

**Q: How do I add more workers under our vendor?**

The Vendor Admin or Vendor Operator can register new workers at any time via **Register Worker**. Once registered and fingerprint enrolled, they are immediately available at all approved companies.

---

**Q: Can a worker be at two companies on the same day?**

Yes. If your vendor is approved at multiple companies, a worker can mark IN/OUT at any of them. Each record shows which company it was marked at.

---

**Q: What if a worker forgot to mark OUT?**

The Company Admin can see these workers in **Attendance → Exceptions**. Manual corrections can be made from there.

---

**Q: How do I view a worker's full attendance history?**

Click any worker's row in the **Workers** list or **Attendance Log** to open the **Worker Detail** analytics page. It shows total days worked, average hours, monthly breakdowns, and recent attendance — all scoped to your company.

---

**Q: Can I download a worker's Aadhaar document?**

Vendor users can download any worker's Aadhaar PDF from the Workers list (ID Document column) or in edit mode (Step 0). Company admin/gate users can also download if the worker has attended or been deployed at their company.

---

**Q: I cancelled a worker deployment but they still appear in the Previous Workers tab. Is that correct?**

Yes. Once a worker has marked attendance at your company, they will always appear in the **Previous Workers** tab — even if the deployment is later cancelled. This ensures a complete history is maintained.

---

**Q: How do I change a gate user's password?**

The Company Admin goes to **Users**, finds the gate user, clicks the edit icon, enters a new password, and saves.

---

**Q: I cannot log in — it says incorrect password.**

Make sure you are using the exact email and password provided by your admin. Passwords are case-sensitive. Contact your Super Admin or Company Admin to reset your password.

---

**Q: The vendor was approved but we want to stop them. What do we do?**

The Company Admin goes to **Vendor Approvals → Approved** tab, then clicks **Suspend** next to the vendor. Their workers' fingerprints will immediately stop working at your gate. You can re-approve them later.

---
