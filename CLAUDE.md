## What This Project Is

**AMS (Attendance Management System)** — enterprise multi-company, multi-vendor labor registration and biometric attendance system.

Workers are registered by vendor companies, deployed to client companies, and mark attendance via fingerprint scanning at site gates. The system tracks who is where, when, and for how long.

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | Laravel 11, PHP 8.3, PHP-FPM |
| Frontend | React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query v5 |
| Database | MySQL 8 |
| Cache/Queue | Redis |
| Reverse proxy | Nginx |
| PDF extraction | Python FastAPI (`pdf-service/`) via `pdfplumber` |
| Biometric | SecuGen SGIBIOSRV (Windows service, `https://localhost:8443`) |
| Auth | Laravel Sanctum (Bearer token, 7-day expiry) |
| Containerisation | Docker Compose (7 containers) |

---

## Roles

| Role | Key abilities |
|------|--------------|
| `super_admin` | Full access — creates companies, vendors, all users |
| `company_admin` | Approves vendors, creates gate users, views company attendance/workers |
| `company_gate` | Marks IN/OUT fingerprint attendance only |
| `vendor_admin` | Registers workers, deploys to companies, views worker attendance |
| `vendor_operator` | Registers workers only |

**Backend helpers on `User` model:** `isSuperAdmin()`, `isCompanyUser()`, `isVendorUser()`

---

## Business Flow (End-to-End)

```
1. Super Admin creates Company + Vendor (with login credentials)
2. Vendor Admin → Company Access page → sends access request
3. Company Admin → Vendor Approvals page → approves vendor
4. Vendor Admin → Register Worker → Aadhaar PDF upload + fingerprint enrollment
5. Vendor Admin → Deploy Workers → assigns worker to company with date range
6. Company Admin → Users → creates Gate User accounts (one per entry point)
7. Gate User → Mark Attendance → fingerprint scan → IN / OUT recorded
8. All roles → view attendance in daily-summary grouped view
9. Click any worker row → Worker Detail analytics page
```

---

## Docker Architecture

```
Browser → ams_nginx (:80)
  /     → ams_frontend  (React/Vite :5173)  [VOLUME MOUNTED — live reload]
  /api  → ams_backend   (Laravel PHP-FPM :9000) [BAKED IMAGE — needs docker cp]
             ↕ ams_mysql (:3306)
             ↕ ams_redis (:6379)
             ↕ ams_pdf_service (:8001)  [Python FastAPI]
         ams_queue  [Laravel queue:work]
```

**CRITICAL:** Backend PHP is baked into the image — not volume-mounted.
Every backend change requires:
```bash
docker cp backend/app/Http/Controllers/SomeController.php \
  ams_backend:/var/www/html/app/Http/Controllers/SomeController.php
docker exec ams_backend php artisan optimize:clear
```
Frontend changes are instant (volume mount, Vite HMR).

## Database — Key Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `companies` | Client companies |
| `vendors` | Contractor/vendor companies |
| `company_vendors` | Pivot — company↔vendor relationship + `status` (pending/approved/rejected/suspended) |
| `users` | All users with `role` + `company_id` or `vendor_id` |
| `workers` | Registered workers — `status`, `fingerprint_template` (AES encrypted), `aadhaar_pdf_path`, `fingerprint_enrolled_at` |
| `worker_id_documents` | Additional ID documents (Aadhaar, PAN, etc.) — `document_path` on private disk |
| `worker_assignments` | Worker↔company deployments — `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`, `is_locked` |
| `attendance_logs` | Each IN/OUT event — `type` (IN/OUT), `worker_id`, `company_id`, `marked_at`, `gate`, `fingerprint_score` |
| `audit_logs` | Every sensitive action with user, action string, model, IP |

**Key design decisions:**
- `workers.aadhaar_pdf_path` is in `$hidden` — use `has_aadhaar_pdf` accessor (in `$appends`) to check presence
- Aadhaar PDF stored via `AadhaarController` → `workers.aadhaar_pdf_path` (NOT in `worker_id_documents`)
- Other docs stored via `WorkerIdDocumentController` → `worker_id_documents.document_path`
- Both on `Storage::disk('private')` — never web-accessible, served via authenticated download endpoints
- `worker_assignments.is_locked = true` on first attendance mark; cancel still allowed if latest log type is OUT
- `fingerprint_template` AES-encrypted via Laravel `encrypt()`/`decrypt()`

## Frontend Pages (src/pages/)

| Page | Route | Who sees it | Notes |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| `Dashboard` | `/dashboard` | all | Today's summary stats |
| `CompanyList` | `/companies` | super_admin | CRUD companies + company admin creation |
| `VendorList` | `/vendors` | super_admin, company_admin, company_gate | Super admin: global list + create. **Company users: approval-status tabs (Approved/Pending/Suspended/Rejected/All)** fetched from `/companies/{id}/vendors` |
| `VendorApproval` | `/vendors/approval` | super_admin, company_admin | **Tabs: Pending/Approved/Rejected/Suspended/(Not Requested for SA)/All** with counts |
| `VendorCompanyAccess` | `/vendors/company-access` | vendor_admin, vendor_operator | Request access to companies, track status |
| `VendorProfile` | `/profile` | vendor_admin, vendor_operator | Vendor org details |
| `WorkerList` | `/workers` | all | **All/Current/Previous tabs**; row click → WorkerDetail; ID Document column with download |
| `WorkerDetail` | `/workers/:id` | all | Analytics: stats, monthly breakdown, deployment history (vendor only), recent attendance. **Company users: fixed to their company. Vendor users: company dropdown** |
| `WorkerRegister` | `/workers/register` `/workers/:id/edit` | super_admin, vendor_admin, vendor_operator | 4-step wizard. **Edit mode (Step 0): shows existing doc download links** |
| `WorkerAssign` | `/workers/assign` | super_admin, vendor_admin | **Current/Previous/All tabs**; cancel allowed even when locked (if worker OUT) |
| `UserList` | `/users` | super_admin, company_admin | Role-scoped user management |
| `AttendanceMark` | `/attendance/mark` | super_admin, company_admin, company_gate | Fingerprint IN/OUT via SGIBIOSRV |
| `AttendanceList` | `/attendance` | all | **Daily summary grouped view** (not raw IN/OUT). All/Current/Previous tabs. Row click → WorkerDetail |
| `AttendanceExceptions` | `/attendance/exceptions` | all | Workers currently inside (IN without OUT) |
| `FingerprintTest` | `/diagnostic/fingerprint` | super_admin, company_admin, vendor_admin | Scanner diagnostics |

## Backend Controllers

| Controller | Key methods | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|
| `AuthController` | `login`, `logout`, `me` | Sanctum token auth |
| `CompanyController` | CRUD, `approveVendor`, `rejectVendor`, `suspendVendor`, `companyVendors` | Role-gated |
| `VendorController` | CRUD, `requestCompany`, `availableCompanies` | |
| `WorkerController` | CRUD, `activate`, `deactivate`, `enrollFingerprint`, `stats`, `servePhoto` | `stats()` scoped by company; `servePhoto()` named route `worker.photo` |
| `WorkerAssignmentController` | `index` (deployment filter), `store`, `destroy` | Cancel checks latest log type before allowing on locked assignments |
| `WorkerIdDocumentController` | `index`, `store`, `download`, `destroy` | Accepts images + PDF; company users allowed if worker associated |
| `AadhaarController` | `extract`, `upload`, `download` | Company users allowed to download if worker attended their company |
| `AttendanceController` | `mark`, `workerTemplates`, `index` (deployment filter), `dailySummary`, `exceptions`, `report` | `dailySummary()` groups by worker+company+date |
| `UserController` | CRUD (role-scoped) | |

## Key Frontend Patterns

**Private file downloads (blob):**
```js
const r = await api.get(url, { responseType: 'blob' });
const blob = URL.createObjectURL(r.data);
const a = document.createElement('a');
a.href = blob; a.download = filename;
document.body.appendChild(a); a.click();
URL.revokeObjectURL(blob);
```

**Deployment tabs (All / Current / Previous):**
```js
const deploymentParam = tab !== "all" ? tab : undefined;
api.get('/workers', { params: { deployment: deploymentParam } })
```

**Role checks in React:**
```js
const isSuperAdmin  = user?.role === "super_admin";
const isCompanyUser = ["company_admin", "company_gate"].includes(user?.role);
const isVendorUser  = ["vendor_admin", "vendor_operator"].includes(user?.role);
const canRegister   = ["super_admin", "vendor_admin", "vendor_operator"].includes(user?.role);
const canActivate   = ["super_admin", "company_admin", "vendor_admin"].includes(user?.role);
```

**Row click → worker detail (with stopPropagation on action cells):**
```jsx
<tr onClick={() => navigate(`/workers/${w.id}`)} className="cursor-pointer">
  <td onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>  {/* actions cell */}
```

**Company dropdown for vendor users in WorkerDetail:**
- Options populated once on first unfiltered load via `useEffect` with `companyOptions === null` guard
- Passes `?company_id=X` to `/workers/:id/stats` when selected

## Aadhaar Flow

1. Vendor clicks "Open UIDAI Portal" → worker downloads masked Aadhaar PDF
2. `POST /api/aadhaar/extract` → Python pdf-service extracts name/DOB/gender/address/photo (no storage)
3. Form auto-fills; vendor reviews
4. `POST /api/aadhaar/upload/{worker}` → PDF stored at `private/aadhaar/aadhaar_{id}_{ts}.pdf`
5. `workers.aadhaar_pdf_path` updated; `has_aadhaar_pdf` accessor returns `true`
6. `GET /api/aadhaar/download/{worker}` → serves PDF; company users allowed if worker associated

**PDF password:** first 4 letters of name (UPPERCASE) + birth year → `NARE1955`

---

## Fingerprint Flow (Gate)

```
1. Browser → POST https://localhost:8443/SGIFPCapture   (capture live template)
2. Browser → GET  /api/attendance/worker-templates      (all enrolled, decrypted templates for approved vendors)
3. Browser → POST https://localhost:8443/SGIMatchScore  (1:N parallel match, score 0–200)
4. Best score ≥ 40 → confirm dialog → POST /api/attendance/mark
```
- `Content-Type: text/plain` on SGIBIOSRV calls avoids CORS preflight
- Templates decrypted server-side before sending to browser

## Common Gotchas

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Backend change not taking effect | No volume mount on backend — saving file does nothing | `docker cp` file + `php artisan optimize:clear` |
| `Route [worker.photo] not defined` | Named route missing | Route must have `->name('worker.photo')` in api.php |
| `id_documents` vs `idDocuments` | Laravel serialises relationships as snake_case JSON | Use `existingWorker?.id_documents` (not `idDocuments`) in React |
| `aadhaar_pdf_path` always null/empty | Field is in `$hidden` | Check `has_aadhaar_pdf` (in `$appends`) instead |
| Aadhaar vs other docs | Two separate systems | Aadhaar: `workers.aadhaar_pdf_path` via `AadhaarController`; others: `worker_id_documents.document_path` via `WorkerIdDocumentController` |
| `COUNT(DISTINCT alias)` MySQL error | MySQL can't count by alias in same SELECT | Use `selectRaw('COUNT(DISTINCT DATE(marked_at)) as cnt')->value('cnt')` |
| PDF rejected on ID doc upload | Old validation used `image` rule | Validation: `'max:10240\|mimes:jpeg,png,jpg,pdf'` |
| Static route shadowed by dynamic | `/workers/register` vs `/workers/:id` | In App.jsx: put static routes before `/:id` |
| Cancel blocked on locked assignment | Old code blocked all cancels when `is_locked=true` | Now checks latest log — cancel allowed if type is OUT |

## Development Workflow

### Adding a new backend endpoint
1. Edit `backend/app/Http/Controllers/SomeController.php`
2. Register in `backend/routes/api.php`
3. `docker cp` both files into `ams_backend`
4. `docker exec ams_backend php artisan optimize:clear`
5. Test via React frontend

### Adding a new frontend page
1. Create `frontend/src/pages/.../NewPage.jsx`
2. Import and add route in `frontend/src/App.jsx`
3. Add nav item to `frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx` (NAV array) if needed
4. Changes are live immediately (Vite HMR)

### Making DB schema changes
```bash
docker exec ams_backend php artisan make:migration add_column_to_table
# Edit migration file, then:
docker exec ams_backend php artisan migrate
```
